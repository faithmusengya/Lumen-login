## Laravel Micro-Framework

Lumen is a new project from Laravel creator Taylor Otwell. It's a "micro-framework", meaning it's a smaller, faster, leaner version of a full web application framework. PHP has two other popular micro-frameworks, Slim and Silex. Lumen has the same foundation as Laravel, and many of the same components.
